Custome Criteria files can be singular criteria or combined with multiple criteria:

Single_  >> Means the criteria will return for a single celestrial datapoint / search type

NOTE:
ObsCore has received a complete UI Overhaul which was released as ObsCore_v1.0 on 2024-09-02
While the Custom Criteria written for the original ObsCore_v0.x will remain valid - the new
ObsCore_v1.x Environment contains many tools to simplify writing of plugins and custom criteria- 
and the new criteria will NOT be backwards compatible....Please make sure you are selecting the 
correct version of ObsCore / Plugins / Custom Criteria etc

I will keep the Custom Criteria Files I host in separate folders to assist in recognizing their
validity
