ObsCore v0.x was from introduction as replacement for ELite Observatory - and 2024-09-02 - when ObsCore v1.0 was  released - with completely revamped UI

While the Custom Criteria should continue to work with either version - the newer format offers both simpler and more powerful Custom Criteria toolset - which will NOT be backwards compatible...So this folder will contain only ObsCore v0.x Criteria

Cmdr Julian Ford' "Custom Criteria For Everyone" files / updates - can be downloaded from the 'Independent Explorers Association' (IEA) Discord \ Observatory-Criteria channel:
